# Text Adventure Engine

A text-based interactive fiction engine created using Tauri and TypeScript.

## Overview

This project is a text adventure engine designed to provide an immersive experience for players through a command-line interface. It's built with Tauri, a framework for creating desktop applications with web technologies, and TypeScript for coding consistency and type safety.

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Engage in an adventure by exploring rooms, collecting items, interacting with NPCs, and solving puzzles.
- **Standardized Verbs**: Recognize and process user input using standardized verbs for action commands.
- **Item Customization**: Customize item behavior and effects upon interaction within the game.
- **Room and Player Management**: Manage player inventory, room transitions, and item interactions.
- **Modularity**: Organize the codebase into manageable modules and classes for better maintainability.

## Roadmap

### Version 1.0 (Upcoming)
- Implement basic room and item interactions.
- Enhance user input recognition.
- Develop core gameplay mechanics.

### Version 2.0 (Future)
